# Hotel Reviews and Ratings Prediction

## Overview

This project revolves around the exploration and analysis of hotel reviews, aiming to predict ratings based on customer experiences. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques, we delve into feature engineering and model design to gain insights from textual data and enhance the accuracy of rating predictions.

## Project Highlights

- **NLP Feature Engineering:** Utilized advanced NLP tools for extracting meaningful features from hotel reviews, capturing sentiments and nuances expressed by customers.

- **Deep Learning Model:** Designed a robust neural network model incorporating Bidirectional LSTMs, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and dense layers to predict hotel ratings based on textual features.

- **Predictive Analytics:** Implemented a comprehensive prediction framework, combining NLP insights with deep learning methodologies to anticipate and forecast hotel ratings with precision.
